=head1 NAME

Business::BR::RG - Perl module to test for correct RG numbers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use Business::BR::RG;

print "ok " if test_rg('390.533.447-05'); # prints 'ok '
print "bad " unless test_rg('231.002.999-00'); # prints 'bad '

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The RG number is an identification number of Brazilian citizens
emitted by the Department of Public Safety, which is called
"Secretaria de Segurança Pública (SSP)".

RG stands for "Cadastro Geral" because is valid in all brazil territory.
May be use as passport to Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Chile.

The RG is comprised of a base of 8 digits and one check digit.
It is usually written like '12.002.999-0' so as to be
more human-readable.

This module provides C<test_rg> for checking that a RG number
is I<correct>. Here a I<correct RG number> means

=over 4

=item *

it is 9 digits long

=item *

it satisfies the check equation mentioned below

=back

Before checking, any non-digit letter is stripped, making it
easy to test formatted entries like '21.002.999-00' and
entries with extra blanks like '   99.221.222-00  '.
Except the letter X, because it's represents the number 10.

=over 4

=item B<test_rg>

test_rg('39.985.676-X') # incorrect RG, returns 0
test_rg(' 39.985.676-6 ') # is ok, returns 1
test_rg('123') # nope, returns undef

Tests whether a RG number is correct. Before testing,
any non-digit [except X, no matter its case] character is stripped.
Then it is
expected to be 9 digits long and to satisfy
check equation which validate the check digit.
See L</"THE CHECK EQUATIONS">.

The policy to get rid of '.' and '-' is very liberal.
It indeeds discards anything that is not a digit (0, 1, ..., 9, or X)
or letter. That is handy for discarding spaces as well

test_rg(' 39.985.676-6 ') # is ok, returns 1

But extraneous inputs like '3.9.9 8w5.6w7h6?6' are
also accepted. If you are worried about this kind of input,
just check against a regex:

warn "bad RG: only digits (9) expected"
	unless ($rg =~ /^\d{8}(\d|x)$/i);

warn "bad RG: does not match mask '__.___.___-_'"
	unless ($rg =~ /^\d{2}\.\d{3}\.\d{3}-(\d|x)$/i);

NOTE. Integer numbers like 1234567
with fewer than 8 digits will be normalized (eg. to
"001234567") before testing.

=item B<canon_rg>

canon_rg(99); # returns '000000099'
canon_rg('99.999.999-9'); # returns '999999999'

Brings a candidate for a RG number to a canonical form.
In case,
the argument is an integer, it is formatted to at least
9 digits. Otherwise, it is stripped of any
non-alphanumeric [again, except x] characters and returned as it is.

=item B<format_rg>

format_rg('00000000'); # returns '00.000.000-0'

Formats its input into '00.000.000-0' mask.
First, the argument is canon'ed and then
dots and hyphen are added to the first
9 digits of the result.
So you can call format_rg even when its already formated.

=item B<parse_rg>

($base, $dv) = parse_rg($rg);
$hashref = parse_rg('99.222.111-0'); # { base => '99222111', dv => '0' }

Splits a candidate for RG number into base and check
digits (dv - dígitos de verificação). It canon's
the argument before splitting it into 8- and 1-digit
parts. In a list context,
returns a two-element list with the base and the check
digits. In a scalar context, returns a hash ref
with keys 'base' and 'dv' and associated values.

=item B<random_rg>

$rand_rg = random_rg($valid);

$correct_rg = random_rg();
$rg = random_rg(1); # also a correct RG
$bad_rg = random_rg(0); # an incorrect RG

Generates a random RG. If $valid is omitted or 1, it is guaranteed
to be I<correct>. If $valid is 0, it is guaranteed to be I<incorrect>.
This function is intented for mass test. (Use it wisely.)

The implementation is simple: just generate a 8-digits random number,
hopefully with a uniform distribution and then compute the check digits.
If $valid==0, the check digits are computed B<not to> satisfy the
check equations.

=back

=head2 EXPORT

C<test_rg> is exported by default. C<canon_rg>, C<format_rg>,
C<parse_rg> and C<random_rg> can be exported on demand.


=head1 THE CHECK EQUATIONS

A correct RG number has one check digit which are computed
from the base 8 first digits. Consider the RG number
written as 9 digits

c[1] c[2] c[3] c[4] c[5] c[6] c[7] c[8] dv[1]

To check whether a RG is correct or not, it has to satisfy
the check equations:

c[1]*2 + c[2]*3 + c[3]*4 + c[4]*5 + c[5]*6 + c[6]*7 + c[7]*8 + c[8]*9 +
dv[9] * 100 = 0 (mod 11)



=head1 BUGS

until now I do not found any RG that has less than 8 digits.
But, I guess, old people still have it.
For now, this is the only way that I found to check RG.
If you found any bug, feel free to send e-mail, open an issue on github or open a RT.

=head1 SEE ALSO

Note that this module only tests correctness.
It doesn't enter the merit whether the RG number actually exists
at the Brazilian government databases.

Please reports bugs via CPAN RT or github.
